Peer1on1 enjoyed a hiking activity on June 28th, at Rancho Los Alamitos. Each autistic participant was partnered up with a volunteer for better communication. The scenery was beautiful, and we helped the participants complete a worksheet. The worksheet included pictures of random objects that the participants tried to find in the museum. We climbed up short hills and down a few valleys, and overall had a wonderful experience. At the end, we watched a video on the history of the museum.
