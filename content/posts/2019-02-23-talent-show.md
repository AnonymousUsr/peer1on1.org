On Saturday, February 23rd, from 6:00 – 8:00 PM, Peer1on1 hosted their second talent show where children of varying ages from elementary to high school could reveal their talents. This gave autistic children a chance at a stage to show their talents and shine on stage. High school students from Cypress High, Los Alamitos High, Whitney High, Oxford Academy, and an orchestra group from nearby city also participated in the performance. The event was an instant success from the start, and each audience member gave their high praise to the show and the performers. Overall, there was a great turnout in the audience and we at Peer1on1 wish for this community to continue to grow at this rate. We thank 99 Ranch Market and 85°C Bakery for sponsoring our organization.
