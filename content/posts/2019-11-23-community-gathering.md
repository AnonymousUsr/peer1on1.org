On 11/23/19, Peer 1 on 1 held an event celebrating the Seal Beach X-mas tree lighting at Seal Beach Elsenhower Park.  Everyone enjoyed coming outdoors to celebrate the holidays. Peers enjoyed many activities together including hiking on the beach, kite flying, and toy hunting.  It was rewarding to see all the smiles on the kid's faces.

Later in the evening, everyone watched the performances, played in the snow, ice skate, watched the lighting of the Xmas tree and welcomed Santa riding in on the trash truck.

A big Thank You to all the volunteers and the parents making time on a busy holiday weekend to make this event successful.
