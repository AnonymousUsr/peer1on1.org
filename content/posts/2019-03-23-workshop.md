On 3/23/19, Peer 1 on 1 invited guest speaker Dr. Gail Singer-Chang, founder of FACE (Faculty for Autism Collaboration & Education) and medical educator for 20 years, to give peers a workshop on how to interact with and make kids who are autistic feel more comfortable in their environment. As a mother of a child with autism, Dr. Singer-Chang understands well what helps people with autism feel included and loved. Dr. Singer-Chang taught volunteers so many more ways to include people with autism in their games and daily lives. She taught peers that all they really need to do is be a friend. We are so grateful for this chance to learn more about inclusiveness and understanding our peers! Thank you so much Dr. Singer-Chang!
