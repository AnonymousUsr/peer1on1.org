Today, Peer1on1 raised money for our non-profit cause by holding a fundraising sale at Seal Beach’s Ralphs. Volunteers were split into four different time groups, and sold pastries that 85°C kindly donated, popcorn, chips, and other foods.

The fundraiser was a huge success, with many of Rossmoor’s residents actively donating to our organization.
