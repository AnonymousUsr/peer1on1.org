On October 26, 2019, Oxford Academy’s Peer 1 on 1 held a garage sale that raised money for the organization. The garage sale was in the Buena Park near the intersection of Valley View and Ball Road. Event was from 7:00am to 2:00pm, and many volunteers including students, parents and young kids were able to come and help sell brand new clothes, jewelry, toys and lemonade.

Thank you, both parent and volunteers for your support. A special thanks to our donors. Without everyone’s help and support such a successful event couldn’t have happened. We hope you are able to join us for our next event!
