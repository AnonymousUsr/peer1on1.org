On October 19, 2019, Peer1on1 held a card making event inviting any people on the spectrum to come and make cards. Each peer was assigned to an autistic child, and we all had a lot of fun making cards. The children made thank you cards to their parents or simply decorative cards in which they wrote whatever they wanted. After card making, we played some games like “Simon Says” and practiced listening skills. We hope everyone enjoyed this event, and if you didn’t come, we hope you are able to join us for our next event!
