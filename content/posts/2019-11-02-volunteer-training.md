On November 2, Peer 1 on 1 was excited to host a volunteer training session with Mrs. Lisa Chattler as our speaker! The session was wonderful and very informative. The audience was very engaged and interested in Mrs. Chattlerâ€™s speaking! We learned a lot about autism and how it affects the children, and also how to respond best to children with autism when they need help. Mrs. Chattler gave us many suggestions on how to improve our future events so that they will be even more fun and engaging! Thank you so much for giving us your time, Mrs. Chattler!
