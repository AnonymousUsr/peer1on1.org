Today, Peer1on1 had multiple activities. To start off, the volunteers met together to decide how to organize the activity. Then we started the main event, a basketball activity where volunteers started off by shooting a few hoops with our participants.

Some pairs were passing to each other, and some were even practicing their stealing with their partners. Afterwards, we all split up into two equal teams, with equal pairs of volunteers and participants, and played basketball.

It was a bit of a challenge for our newer members, but it was very rewarding.

While this was going on, other participants could also decide to play on the playground, or fly a kite. After all of our activities, everyone enjoyed a snack break together, with pizza, chips, and water.
