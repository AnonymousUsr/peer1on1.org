On this date, Peer1on1 had a hiking activity at Shipley Nature, where the tour guides guided us through their Nature Center. First, we started off with the volunteers having a meeting. We then met up with the participants, and started the tour. The tour guides showed us many wondrous sights, and gave us background history on many plants and animals we spotted along our way. Both volunteers and participants were fascinated at the history behind the views. After the tour was finished, we thanked our tour guides and went outside for lunch and snacks. But first, we had a few games. We played multiple rounds of red light green light, which caught everyoneâ€™s attention. After, we played games that required a bit more thought, such as Simon Says. We all enjoyed some pizza, chips, and popcorn at the end of our activity, and everyone had great fun.
