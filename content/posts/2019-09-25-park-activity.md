The Cerritos Peer 1 on 1 event for August occurred from 10:00AM - 12:00 PM at Don Knabe Regional Park. Going into planning this event, we wished to encourage students with autism to stay physically active and appreciate the wonders of outdoor sports.

A while later, some of the peers took turns flying a kite with the encouragement of some of our volunteers. Afterwards, the peers took a walk around the park, fished, played a bit more basketball, and worked out at a nearby exercise station.

Everyone had a great time and it was good to see the peersâ€™ laughing faces throughout the event!
