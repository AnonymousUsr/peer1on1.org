This Tuesday, April 6th, peer 1 on 1 had an online event in which peers and volunteers spent some time drawing pictures. Everyone was able to channel their inner artist and draw a nice sunny beach, along with anything they wanted on the sand. Some of us drew cats, cars, seashells, and some people even drew eggs! Overall, we all had a great experience during this time of quarantine drawing and making new friends.
